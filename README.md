## Description
The Secure Password Generator is a user-friendly tool designed to help you create new, 
strong, and secure passwords that meet your specific criteria. 


## Usage
The Secure Password Generator provides an intuitive interface for creating secure passwords. Follow the steps below to generate your password:


To begin, simply click the "Generate Password" button in red. You'll be prompted to indicate your preferred password length. Should your chosen length not meet the required criteria, an alert will pop up, prompting you to select an acceptable password length. In case this happens, the password generation process will cease, necessitating a restart.

Once you've successfully chosen the desired password length, the next step involves selecting whether you want to include numbers, special characters, lowercase letters, and/or uppercase letters in your password. If you decide not to include any of these options, a notification will appear alerting you that an empty password is not allowed. Consequently, the password generation process will be terminated.

Following your character selection, the password generation will commence, producing a randomized password displayed above the "Generate Password" button.
